* Type casting  (primitive data types)
What is the syntax for type casting? --> We use () and inside the () we write the destination data type
For example: --> to convert a long data type to an int this is how we can do it:

    long var1 =250; 
    int var2 = (int) var1;  --> this is called Explicit/narrowing/Manual
    double var3 =var2 ---> this is called Implicit/widening/automatic
    
    If else conditions ---> If else conditions helps us write codes that the decision based on data.
    For example --> If (the given username and password matches)
    {go to home page} else {given user a warning}
    For example:
    boolean isHungry = true;
    
    if (isHungry) {
    System.out.println("Eat some penne pasta");
    }else{
    System.out.println("Drink some water and go to sleep");
        }
